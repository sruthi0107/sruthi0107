### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a master's student in the Applied Computing program at the University of Toronto. I enjoy delving into and reading the latest research in various fields of AI!
I am passionate about various subdomains in computer vision and have recently been exploring it's intersection with NLP. I am particularly interested in 3D Vision, Generative AI, Representation learning and Multimodal models.

If you'd like to collaborate or chat about anything AI related, reach me at any of my socials or drop me an email at sruthi0107@gmail.com!!
